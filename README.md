# VESC based one wheeled PEV configs

* My configs or configs I backed up for friends.
* Feel free to take a peak. Keep in mind that I'm no tune wizard. [ZdenÄ›k](https://www.instagram.com/louckazdenekjr/) is. ;)
* Configs may come and go, change, may not be intended for use with Floatwheel, be completely broken etc.

GL&HF. Float on.
